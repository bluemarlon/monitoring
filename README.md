# monitoring
The R-Shiny introduction.

The "appmodelmonitor.R" is the main file showing the introduction.
It contains three chunks total, consisting of the EDA of the data, modeling and also the monitoring. 
The descriptions of different sections are provided in the code.
The "clustering_forecasting.R" is the code doing the clustering and also the forecasting model.
Note, the datasets saved the results of the modeling section as it takes couple minutes to run, which is slow for the presentation.
The main file does not use it doing modeling while compiling the R-shiny.
The "monitoring.R" is for the monthly monitoring model.
